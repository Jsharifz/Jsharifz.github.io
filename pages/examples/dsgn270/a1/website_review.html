                <h2>Summary of <em>bestbuy.ca</em></h2>
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>- Easy navigation for both desktop and mobile</li>
                <li>- Scales nicely for mobile users with gesture feature</li>
                <li>- Would improve experience if top nav bar is floating rather than fixed</li>
                <li>- Could include better search engine to reduce potential unnecessary strain</li>
                <li>- Poor accessibility as no alt texts were present, or any alt texts present were unrelated to the image</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
                <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Best Buy Canada is an important place to me as it was the company I had recently worked with. Over the 2 year 8 month journey, I have had to use both <em>bestbuy.ca</em> and as well as the Best Buy mobile app as tools to assist my customers. Strictly speaking about <em>bestbuy.ca</em> and not the app, it was a fairly standard website but it did come with a few flaws that translated to both poor customer service and shopping experience. Navigating <em>bestbuy.ca</em> both on desktop and mobile are both fairly enjoyable experiences as they are easy to navigate. Its modern features allow full scalability for mobile users (without having a ‘.m.’ link format) and the swipe feature works fine for the front page promotion. Although this is a minor issue, I wish the ‘hamburger’ menu and the search bar was floating so that I do not have to scroll to the very top of the page to navigate to other pages.</p>

            <p>Users with either visual or physical impairment may have a harder time navigating the website as the following problems I have noticed. To keep it short, I found one issue I had trouble with myself personally, and one main problem hidden out of plain sight.</p>

            <p>Once again comparing <em>bestbuy.ca</em> to Amazon, this personal problem is for the sorting method for the search feature. Although they allow you to search items if they are on sale and by price range, they do not allow you to rank the search results by pricing (ie: low to high or high to low). This small problem will add significant time to search times when trying to look for an item that will potentially be within budget. There is no reason anyone should navigate to page 3 of the search results to find a potential item of interest that meets anyone’s budget. This issue will affect mostly people with physical impairments as it increases their time spent on the website and the extra amount of effort required to navigate through multiple pages.</p>
            <p>This hidden issue is only discoverable through accessibility evaluation tools either built into the browser, or other websites that follow the WCAG (W3C) 508 compliance. To make sure this evaluation is fair, I used the built-in evaluator of Firefox and <em>webaccessibility.com</em>. Unfortunately for Best Buy, most of the errors were related to images not including alternative texts for images. Firefox is best used to quickly evaluate a page by not only evaluating whether an element is WCAG compliant, but it also highlights the element on the screen that needs to be looked into. <em>webaccessibility.com</em> gave <em>bestbuy.ca</em> a score of <strong>72%</strong> only because it did pass the contrast and general readability of the font as the website is mostly composed of black text on white background. This issue can be partially mitigated for mobile users as modern phones have accessibility settings that allow visually impaired users to have a better experience. As a side note, some modern phones also have a ‘one handed’ mode that shrinks the phone’s display for better reach to the corners.</p>
