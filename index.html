                    <div class="introduction">
                        I am a Petroleum Reservoir Engineer and Web Developer Student seeking new opportunities and challenges. During my professional experience with ABBOTT Energy and Environment Consulting Inc., I have reinforced my analytical, problem solving and presentation skills. I have researched and studied concepts of shale geochemical properties parameters related to shale studies. My experience with ABBOTT Energy motivated me to become more independent and self dependent as new challenges are regularly introduced.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I have committed over 6 years to understand the fundamentals of how the petroleum industry operates; knowing down to small operations such as recalibrating a valve, maintaining steam pressure in a boiler, and interpreting well log data. This assisted me in providing a realistic expectation on everyday operations. Throughout my studies at SAIT (Southern Alberta Institute of Technology), I have learned how the oil and gas industry operates both upstream and downstream of the operations.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My desire to learn new skills is what challenges me to further enhance my education and expertise for varying industries. Today I am part of the SAIT's Web Developer Fast-Track program to learn the applications of coding languages such as Node.js/JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and etc. by taking on independent and team collaborative relatable assignments. I am confident this shift in my career is essential as the applications of the skills are relevant and universal to all industries.
